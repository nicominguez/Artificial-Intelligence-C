### General info
The "AI_modules" has been created to build small neural networks in C and to understand how a neural network works.
The program for creating neural networks is "AI_modules", "ai".
The "example.c" is an example of how to use "AI_modules", "ai". To compile this example, we have "makefile". Moreover, "net.aic"
is the neural network built by "example.c".

### Installation

First, the repository is installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/eloyUA/Artificial-Intelligence-C
```

Then, the example and "AI_modules" is compiled with a makefile, so make needs to be installed.
```
cd Artificial-Intelligence-C
mkdir /AI_modules/compilations
make compile
```

Finaly, the executable, "example", has been created.

### Example

A neural network will be built to predict the output of f(x, y) = sin(x) - y with x,y in [0, 5]. This function is:

First, the AI is inicialized and the data is prepared. If data (input, output) isn't in [0, 1], it needs to be normalized.

Second, the neural network is built with the number of the layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions and description.

Then, the neural network is trained with the data.

Finaly, the neural network predict a f(x, y) with random x, y values and the net is saved. To open the network file, "net.aic",
the function "openNeuralNet" must be used.
